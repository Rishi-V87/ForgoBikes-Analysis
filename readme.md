## Dataset

> * The Dataset that I choose was for **'ForgoBikes'** and I choose to compare dataset for two years: **2018 and 2019**. As the dataset was too big, I decided to compare the findings for the 'First half of the year' only.
> * Looking at the existing features, it seemed that I had to introduce new features such as:
* Age of the customer from the variable 'member_birth_year'
* Duration of ride in terms of minutes from the variable 'duration_sec'
* The Month of renting the bike from the variable 'start_time'. we will first have to convert the datatype of the variable and then extract the 'month' parameter from the data.
> * Finally after all the changes in the dataset, there were **758,505 and 117,2807** entries in the data set for **2018 and 2019** respectively. There were **13 features** left in each of the dataset after removing and adding new columns to the data sets. Some variables, such as **'end_station_id'**, provided the 'ID' number and were not that important for our visualization.
> * Among the rest, few variables were numbers such as 'age' and 'duration_hours', while others were mostly categorical in nature


## Summary of Findings

> * There were more customers in 2019 (1,172,807) as compared to 2018 (758,505)
> * There were more **Men** as compared to **Women** who rented the bikes in both the years. However, the increase in number of Men was more when compared to increase in number of Women renting bikes in 2019. (~300,000+ men v/s ~85,000+ women)
> * **Female** group was younger than the **male** group
> * **Females** tend to ride or rent the bike for **longer duration** than **men**. The difference was found to be **~ 2 minutes.** Though care needs to be taken that the number of females were significantly lower than the number of males.
> * There was **no** gender preference for any of the Location for renting bikes. The proportion of Male and Females were consistent over the different place and over the years as well.
> * **San Francisco Caltrain Station 2(Townsend St)** and **Berry St at 4th St** were in the **top 3** most popular Renting Location for the year **2018 and 2019**, while **Market St at 10th St** rose from the **5th position in 2018** to **2nd position in 2019** as the most favorable Bike renting place.
> * Most of the people who rented the bikes were between the age group of **20-40** years of age in both the years
> * Younger people were more likely to travel longer distance in both 2018 and 2019.
> * Most of the people travelled for less than **'20 minutes'** with a few going as high as 140 minutes.
> * Almost all of the Renters were 'Subscribers' to the ForgoBikes.
> * The number of renters increased by **100,000** from the month of **March to June in 2018**, whereas steady increase of **50,000** was seen in the month of **March and April for the year 2019**.
> * Average duration of renting or riding bikes **didn't change much** over the course of Months for both the years. The average duration was realized to be about **~8.5 minutes**.
> * There is a slight fluctuation in the **Mean Duration** among the **Months** in the year **2019**. We can observe that the **Average Duration** time for the month of **January and February** are pretty low for **Male and Female** when compared to the rest of the months for the year **2019**




## Key Insights for Presentation

> The following are the key insights of 2018 and 2019 that will be reflected in the presentation deck via graphs:
> * The Age distribution of the customers
> * The Gender distribution of the customers
> * The average Duration of renting the ForgoBikes
> * The preferred locations for renting the ForgoBikes
> * The Monthly distribution of renting the ForgoBikes
> * The change in Duration of renting the bikes based on the gender distribution

> A summary will be provided as to which segment of customer will lead to higher Duration of renting bikes.
